ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Ruan. 

I am originally from South Africa but now reside in the beautiful city of Tauranga, New Zealand.

My work background has been in business and sales and I have had the opportunity to be involved with sales, business development, analysis and inventory management to name a few. 
My real interest however has always been technology and I enjoy coding. So at the start of 2021 I decided to pursue this passion and change industry. 

I have had the opportunity over the last year to work on several projects using React, NodeJS, MySQL and JavaScript. I have also recently started learning C# and using Cloud and AI services. 
There is nothing better for me than to improve myself and my skills, and you will find that I am very open to learning. 

Currently I am looking for employement in the industry and open to freelancing work as well. 

If you would like to make contact with me, email is the best option or you can reach me on some social media platforms:
